Projects and works from Artifical Intelligence (Python)

Homework 1:
BlindBot MazeAgent meant to employ Propositional Logic, Search, Planning, and Active Learning to navigate the Maze Pitfall problem (a maze with an initial and goal state that has pitfalls slowing down the agent).

Homework 2:
Advertisement Selection Engine that employs a Decision Network to Maximize Expected Utility associated with different Decision variables in a stochastic reasoning environment.

Homework 3:
Plays a game of Pacman where Pacman chases and eats ghosts based on their believed positions from emissions (Hidden Markov Modeling). First computes the most likely position of each ghost that has not yet been captured, then chooses an action that brings Pacman closer to the closest ghost (according to mazeDistance!).

Homework 4:
Creates a new SalaryPredictor trained on the given features from the preprocessed census data to predicted salary labels. Performs and fits any preprocessing methods (e.g., imputing of missing features, discretization of continuous variables, etc.) on the inputs, and saves these as attributes to later transform test inputs.
